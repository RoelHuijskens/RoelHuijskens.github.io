            Hi welcome, my name is Roel Huijskens, I am a 23-year-old recently graduated research master student. When I was younger I always enjoyed challenging myself to learn stuff
            that seems difficult. This started on a holiday in Texel where I picked up juggling balls and spent the majority of that summer juggling. My fascination with the human brain and the nervous system which also seemed hard to understand led me to choose psychology
            as my bachelor study. However, during my bachelor's, I discovered that unlike many of my fellow-students I especially enjoyed statistics heavy
            courses, as I  enjoyed the challenge and reward of learning these topics. Therefore I decided to enroll in a high rated Research Master at Utrecht University dedicated to statistics which led to a research internship at
            Statistics Netherlands (CBS).

            <p>
            In my spare time I enjoy tinkering in various programming languages, watching netflix (currently watching dark), and working out. Currently, I am further developing my skills in programming/machine learning and I am looking for my next challenge in statistics and/or data science.

            </p>
